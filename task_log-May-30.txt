[95m## Task:[00m [92mBased on the conversation so far and the latest message I'm looking for concerts or NBA games in NYC this weekend. Preferably something popular or headlined by a major artist., determine whether the user is making a new event search or referring to a previous recommendation. If it's a new query, extract relevant filters such as genre, performer, date and time, price, popularity, and size of the event from this user input I'm looking for concerts or NBA games in NYC this weekend. Preferably something popular or headlined by a major artist.. If it’s a follow-up (e.g. “tell me more about the Knicks game”), identify the referenced event.[00m

User Preferences Extracted from the Input:

- **Event Type:** Concerts and NBA games  
- **Location:** New York City (NYC)  
- **Date and Time:** This weekend (assumed to be the nearest Saturday and Sunday dates from today's date)  
- **Genre:** Concerts likely in mainstream popular genres since the user wants major artists (e.g., pop, rock, hip-hop) and NBA basketball games  
- **Performer:** Major artists headlining concerts; NBA teams that play in NYC (most likely New York Knicks for NBA)  
- **Price:** Not specified in the current message; no explicit budget mentioned here, so price is open  
- **Popularity:** Explicitly stated preference for popular events or those headlined by major artists  
- **Size of Event:** Not explicitly stated, but popularity implies larger venues or events with significant attendance is preferred  

This is a new event search query as the user has not referenced or followed up on any previously suggested event.

These preferences enable a focused search for concerts and NBA games in New York City happening on the upcoming weekend that are popular or feature major headliners, held at large venues such as Madison Square Garden or Barclays Center. Recommendations and ticket purchasing options can be tailored accordingly.[00m

Up (Official Music Video) About Luke Bryan is one of country music’s most prolific hitmakers. The Leesburg, Georgia native began his career writing hit songs for country icons Travis Tritt and Billy Currington. Since breaking out in 2011 with the record-breaking single "Country Girl (Shake It For Me),” Bryan has produced 12 No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart and more RIAA-certified digital singles than anyone in country music. His accomplishments include selling nearly 13 million albums, with four No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200, and hits like "Huntin', Fishin' and Lovin' Every Day'' showcase the relatable Americana and catchy hooks that have made him a five-time ACM Awards Entertainer of the Year. On the road, Bryan has played sold-out tours for over 14 million fans worldwide, including 2014’s That's My Kind of Night Tour (the highest-grossing country tour of that year). Since 2018, the country music icon has also been a judge on American Idol alongside Katy Perry and Lionel Richie.  To connect with Luke Bryan: Website (Opens in new tab) // Instagram (Opens in new tab) // YouTube (Opens in new tab) // TikTok (Opens in new tab) // Facebook (Opens in new tab) // Twitter (Opens in new tab) // Spotify (Opens in new tab) Luke Bryan 2025 Tour Dates: 02/06/25 – Scottsdale, AZ @ Coors Light Birds Nest at TPC Scottsdale 03/23/25 – Houston, TX @ NRG Stadium 05/15/25 – Atwater, CA @ The Castle Airport 05/16/25 – Clovis, CA @ The Ponds at Harlan Ranch 05/17/25 – Shafter, CA @ Sillect Farms 05/29/25 – Bethel, NY @ Bethel Woods Center for the Arts 05/30/25 – Holmdel, NJ @ PNC Bank Arts Center 05/31/25 – Wantagh, NY @ Northwell at Jones Beach Theater 06/05/25 – Syracuse, NY @ Empower Federal Credit Union at Amphitheater at Lakeview 06/06/25 – Camden, NJ @ Freedom Mortgage Pavilion 06/07/25 – Raleigh, NC @ Coastal Credit Union Music Park at Walnut Creek 06/12/25 – Savannah, GA @ Enmarket Arena 06/13/25 – Orlando, FL @ Kia Center 06/19/25 – Rogers, AR @ Walmart AMP 06/20/25 – Dallas, TX @ Dos Equis Pavilion 06/21/25 – Lafayette, LA @ Lafayette Cajundome 06/27/25 – North Platte, NE @ Wild West Arena 07/10/25 – Toronto, ON @ Budweiser Stage 07/11/25 – Cuyahoga Falls, OH @ Blossom Music Center 07/12/25 – Hershey, PA @ Hersheypark Stadium 07/17/25 – Greenville, SC @ Bon Secours Wellness Arena 07/18/25 – Charleston, SC @ Credit One Stadium 07/19/25 – Birmingham, AL @ Coca-Cola Amphitheater 07/31/25 – Maryland Heights, MO @ Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre - St. Louis,  MO 08/01/25 – Cincinnati, OH @ Riverbend Music Center 08/02/25 – Burgettstown, PA @ The Pavilion at Star Lake 08/07/25 – Columbia, MD @ Merriweather Post Pavilion 08/08/25 – Mansfield, MA @ Xfinity Center 08/09/25 – Hartford, CT @ Xfinity Theatre 08/14/25 – Charleston, WV @ Charleston Coliseum 08/16/25 – Virginia Beach, VA @ Veterans United Home Loans Amphitheater at Virginia Beach 08/24/25 – Bangor, ME @ Maine Savings Amphitheater 08/28/25 – Noblesville, IN @ Ruoff Music Center 08/30/25 – Darien Center, NY @ Darien Lake Amphitheater Setlists Country Song Came On at Bethel Woods Center for the Arts Bethel , United States Thu, May 29, 2025 1.

And before school Extremely Disappointed Chicago 2024 by Linda on 1/21/25 Rating: 1 out of 5 Luke was clearly sick at the onset of the concert. He should have canceled the show! We had 2nd row seats and was a huge disappointment! Fantastic show by Chris on 10/11/24 Paycom Center - Oklahoma City Rating: 5 out of 5 From beginning to the end this was a great show! Luke was very interactive with the crowd and sound quality was amazing! Felt like a rock show!! Venue was awesome and Luke put on a great show. by Angi on 10/10/24 Paycom Center - Oklahoma City Rating: 5 out of 5 Had the best time. He sang all of my favorites and he he puts so much energy into his shows. Can't wait to see him again. Amazing showman by Amanda on 10/9/24 Paycom Center - Oklahoma City Rating: 5 out of 5 I think the whole experience was amazing!!! The venue was clean and very nice. The opener were both great even though I had never heard of them!!! Luke Bryan is one of the best performers I’ve seen so far!!! Great job guys. Loved it! by Carmen on 10/8/24 Paycom Center - Oklahoma City Rating: 5 out of 5 I enjoyed meeting Luke Bryan. It was an awesome experience. I hate I didn’t get to see the people opening for him. But you have to take the good with the bad. If you leave Luke’s lounge to come see the others then you lose your place in line backstage.
I hate other sites are buying up the good seats and raising the prices to unbelievable prices. I feel those other ticket sites should only be able to buy upper section. Pretty good show by PyraSkye on 10/8/24 Paycom Center - Oklahoma City Rating: 4 out of 5 Out of the openers, HunterGirl should have gone first and not right before Luke Bryan. Josh Ross was a great opener and should have been right before Luke Bryan instead of being first on stage. Luke Bryan as always put on a great show. Only complaint and mind you this is my opinion, but Luke Bryan should not have been wearing skinny jeans it threw off the whole country esthetic completely. Not the best concert I’ve been to by Gigi on 10/8/24 Paycom Center - Oklahoma City Rating: 4 out of 5 Although I enjoyed Luke Bryan I was a little disappointed in the concert. Wasn't impressed with Hunter Girl. JR was good. I feel there is room for a lot of improvement. I think Luke needs to up his game to improve his shows. Amazing by Brandi on 10/8/24 Paycom Center - Oklahoma City Rating: 5 out of 5 We had a great time! Seats were nice! Found a great price! Best Concert Ever by Shannon on 10/8/24 Paycom Center - Oklahoma City Rating: 5 out of 5 Like put on the best show yet even while still feeling a little under the weather! I highly recommend going to see Luke live if you can. Not being a country fan, he has gained a new one! Thanks for the great time!
